# UFOs

## Summary

The purpose of this project was to create a webpage that would take data about UFO sightings and present them in a filterable format. Along with this is an article by Ufologists to provide a narrative about what this webpage is about.

Technology used in this project includes Javascript, HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS. Couldn't have one without the other in this. Javascript was used to bring in the base table along with the filter functions however the layout was rough around the edges. Bootstrap and CSS was used to clean up the page with dark grey backgrounds and column formatting to provide a nice clean webpage and HTML is the string holding all together.

A recommendation for future development, I think a Interactable Map would be perfect for this to provide a visual layout of sightings across the world.
